## A simple app to track sleep habits
!Disclamer
This is for my Year 12 project. This isn't an actual application.

Built with PyQt6 and QT Designer (fman) & QT Widget Designer.

The goal of the app is to create a time based prediction based on the amount of sleep per week and the amount of sleep aimed to get that night. It uses a polynomial algorithm, AI, to output these results.

Made by vwong50.
